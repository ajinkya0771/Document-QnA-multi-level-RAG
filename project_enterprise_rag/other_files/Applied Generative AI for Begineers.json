Our home planet, Earth, is just one of the\n            many celestial bodies that make up this extraordinary cosmic neighborhood, So, let's\n            embark on a journey through the wonders of our Solar System and explore the secrets it\n            holds!\n\n            1. The Sun - Our Life-Giving Star:\n            At the heart of the Solar System shines the Sun, a brilliant ball of hot gas that provides light\n            and warmth to all the planets. Its colossal energy sustains life on Earth and fuels the intricate\n            dance of celestial bodies around it. The Sun's fiery surface is a mesmerizing dance of solar\n            flares and sunspots, revealing its ever-changing nature.\n\n2. Mercury - The Swiftest Planet:\n Moving closer to the Sun, we encounter Mercury, the closest planet to our star. This rocky\ndesolate world is a scorching hellscape during the day and a freezing tundra at night. It\nspeeds around the Sun, completing an orbit in just 88 Earth days, making it the swiftest\nplanet in the Solar System.\n\n3. Venus - The Enigmatic Beauty:\n Next, we encounter Venus, often called Earth's sister planet due to its similar size and\n composition. However, its atmosphere is a toxic mix of sulfuric acid and suffocating carbon\n dioxide, creating a runaway greenhouse effect. Venus boasts a thick layer of clouds that veils\n its surface, making it one of the most enigmatic and mysterious planets in our Solar System.\n\n4. Earth - Our Blue Marble:\nOur home planet, Earth, stands out as a vibrant oasis in the darkness of space. The only\n known planet to support life, Earth is adorned with lush forests, vast oceans, and a diverse\narray of life forms. Its intricate climate systems and ecosystems make it a haven for living\nbeings to thrive.\n\nFigure 1-4.

Our home planet, Earth, is just one of the many celestial bodies that make up this extraordinary cosmic neighborhood. So, let's embark on a journey through the wonders of our Solar System and explore the secrets it holds!\n\n**1. The Sun - Our Life-Giving Star:**  \nAt the heart of the Solar System shines the Sun, a brilliant ball of hot gas that provides light and warmth to all the planets. Its colossal energy sustains life on Earth and fuels the intricate dance of celestial bodies around it. The Sun's fiery surface is a mesmerizing dance of solar flares and sunspots, revealing its ever-changing nature.\n\n**2. Mercury - The Swiftest Planet:**  \nMoving closer to the Sun, we encounter Mercury, the closest planet to our star. This rocky, desolate world is a scorching hellscape during the day and a freezing tundra at night. It speeds around the Sun, completing an orbit in just 88 Earth days, making it the swiftest planet in the Solar System.\n\n**3. Venus - The Enigmatic Beauty:**  \nNext, we encounter Venus, often called Earth's sister planet due to its similar size and composition. However, its atmosphere is a toxic mix of sulfuric acid and suffocating carbon dioxide, creating a runaway greenhouse effect. Venus boasts a thick layer of clouds that veils its surface, making it one of the most enigmatic and mysterious planets in our Solar System.\n\n**4. Earth - Our Blue Marble:**  \nOur home planet, Earth, stands out as a vibrant oasis in the darkness of space. The only known planet to support life, Earth is adorned with lush forests, vast oceans, and a diverse array of life forms. Its intricate climate systems and ecosystems make it a haven for living beings to thrive.\n\n</td></tr>\n</table>\n\n*Figure 1-4.* _ChatGPT’s output_\n\n","images":[{"name":"img_p21_1.png","height":401.554,"width":340.252,"x":90.874,"y":199.626,"original_width":709,"original_height":837,"rotation":0,"ocr":[{"x":10,"y":806,"w":111,"h":17,"confidence":0.999,"text":"beings to thrive."},{"x":10,"y":780,"w":594,"h":17,"confidence":0.99,"text":"array of life forms.
