# 📚 Document Q&A — Multi-Level RAG Systems

This repository showcases my hands-on implementation of **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** systems — progressing from a **basic local RAG pipeline** to an **enterprise-grade production-style RAG architecture**.

The goal of this repo is to demonstrate **real-world GenAI engineering skills**, not just tutorial-level examples.

## 🚀 Projects in This Repository

### 🔹 Project 1 — Basic Document Q&A (Local RAG)
📂 `project-basic-rag/`

A lightweight, fully local RAG system using:
- Local HuggingFace embeddings
- LlamaIndex vector indexing
- Gradio UI
- No external APIs

**Focus:** Core RAG fundamentals, vector search, and offline Q&A.

👉 Ideal for understanding **how RAG works at the foundation level**.

---

### 🔹 Project 2 — Enterprise Document Q&A System (Advanced RAG)
📂 `project_enterprise_rag/`

A production-style, enterprise-grade RAG pipeline featuring:
- High-quality document parsing (LlamaParse)
- Structured chunking & normalization
- MixedBread embeddings (with fallback support)
- Persistent vector storage
- Context-aware retrieval via LlamaIndex
- Groq-powered LLM responses
- Execution proof via logs, screenshots, and UI
- Dockerized setup

**Focus:** How RAG systems are designed and validated in **real AI teams**.

👉 This project goes **beyond tutorials** and reflects industry-grade RAG architecture.
